## Vibe-Watch Recommender: A Movie Recommendation System üçø
#### Project Overview
Vibe-Watch Recommender is a web-based application designed to provide movie suggestions to users. This project serves as a practical demonstration of integrating a machine learning model with a Python backend and a dynamic, responsive frontend.

The system employs a content-based recommendation algorithm that calculates movie similarity based on metadata such as genre, actors, and director. It also incorporates a pre-calculated sentiment score for each movie, offering a unique approach to suggestions that align with a desired "vibe."

Key Features ‚ú®
Movie Autocomplete: A user-friendly search bar provides real-time movie title suggestions as you type.

Content-Based Recommendations: Get a curated list of movies that are similar to your selected choice.

Sentiment Influence: Recommendations are refined by a pre-calculated sentiment score, helping to surface movies that match a positive or negative tone.

Intuitive User Interface: A clean and simple web interface ensures a seamless user experience.

Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è
Backend: Python 3 (Flask)

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (AJAX)

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Pandas

Data Serialization: Pickle

Architecture üó∫Ô∏è
The application is structured following a simplified Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern:

Model: The core logic resides in a machine learning model, which is serialized using Pickle for efficient loading. This model handles the movie similarity calculations.

View: The user interface, built with HTML and CSS, is responsible for presenting information to the user.

Controller: The Flask backend serves as the central controller, managing application flow by handling HTTP requests, processing user input, and interacting with the model to fetch and serve data to the frontend.

Getting Started üöÄ
Prerequisites
To run this project locally, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x

pip (Python package installer)
```
Installation
Clone the repository from its Git URL:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/vibe-watch-recommender.git
cd vibe-watch-recommender
```
Install the necessary Python dependencies:
```
pip install Flask pandas scikit-learn
```
Verify that the required movies.csv data file is present in the root directory. This file contains the movie metadata and pre-calculated sentiment scores.

How to Run
Start the Flask server from your terminal:
```
python app.py

Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to access the application.
```
Local Development üíª
If you prefer to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repository. All changes you push will be reflected in the project environment.

The only requirement is having Node.js and npm installed. You can install them with nvm.

Follow these steps to set up your local development environment:

```# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

Data üìÇ
The system uses a simplified movies.csv file. This dataset includes a limited number of movies, each with a title, genre, list of actors, director, and a pre-calculated sentiment score. This score is a placeholder for a more complex sentiment analysis model in future iterations.

Future Improvements üìà
This project is an ideal starting point for further development. Potential enhancements include:

Advanced Sentiment Analysis: Implementing a real-time sentiment analysis model (e.g., using NLTK or TextBlob) to analyze user-submitted reviews.

Enhanced Recommendation Algorithms: Exploring more sophisticated algorithms, such as collaborative filtering based on user-item interaction data.

User Interface/User Experience (UI/UX) Enhancements: Improving the visual design and adding more interactive features to the frontend.
